            <h1 id="meet-header">Meet the Stylist</h1>
            <p id="meet-paragraph">I'm North Carolina-born into a military family and have lived many places before settling in Wisconsin. Early on, I expressed my artistic nature through painting and drawing. When selecting a career, hair became my chosen canvas. I graduated from Northwood Technical College with my cosmetology degree in 2023.  As a creative entrepreneur, I love the flexibility and adventure that comes with owning my own business. Since opening Radiant Light, I've enjoyed both serving clients in my chair and traveling as a wedding hairstylist. When I'm not behind the chair, I love exploring new coffee shops or reading a great book. You also might find me enjoying God's creation while canoeing in the Boundary Waters or perched in a treestand!</p>
